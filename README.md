# pytorch-segment-nst
I'm working vehicle parts detection on videos and I have a lot of lebeled data with bounding boxes and segmentation pixels that I'm looking for ways to use in order to create some artistic videos!
# Transferring style on a per-frame basis : Project overview
* Understanding neural style transfer theory.
* Exploring optimization and feed forward methods on static images before working on segments of images then videos.
* Stabilizing video results. 
* Transferring different styles in different segments of the image.
* Training custom models.


## Part I : Optimization method - Static image style transfer
